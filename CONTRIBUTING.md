# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! We welcome proposals that align with our guiding principles.

## How to Propose Changes

1. Open an issue describing the problem or idea.
2. Fork the repository and create a feature branch.
3. Follow the coding standards below and submit a pull request.
4. Discuss your PR in the comments; all contributions go through review.

## Coding Standards

Our approach follows two frameworks:

- **MTSMU** – Maximally Truth-Seeking, Maximally Useful. Strive for clarity and real-world usefulness.
- **HUMMBL** – Highly Useful Mental Model Base Language. Keep code and documentation accessible and easy to learn.

Please include tests for new functionality and ensure `./run-tests.sh` passes.
