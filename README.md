# Hi, I'm Reuben (@rpbxbt) üëã

I'm building at the intersection of AI, deep tech, health, and wellness. My mission is **hw/acc** (health & wellness accelerationism) ‚Äî driving rapid progress toward human flourishing through technology.

## What I'm Building

I'm developing what I call **"Belonging as Knowledge Infrastructure"** ‚Äî systems that help communities build meaningful connections while leveraging collective intelligence for health and wellness outcomes.

Currently working with:
- Claude Code for AI-assisted development
- GitHub Copilot and OpenAI Codex for rapid prototyping
- Prompt engineering and systems architecture for health applications

## Core Principles

**MTSMU** - Maximally Truth-Seeking, Maximally Useful
**HUMMBL** - Highly Useful Mental Model Base Language

These frameworks guide how I approach building technology that genuinely serves human wellbeing.

## Let's Collaborate

I'm looking for partners on health & wellness initiatives that create social experiences promoting healthy lifestyles for all. If you're working on:
- Community-driven wellness platforms
- AI applications for preventive health
- Tools that combine human connection with health outcomes

Let's connect.

## Contributing

Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines on reporting issues and submitting pull requests.

## Issue Tracking

Use the GitHub issue templates when reporting bugs or requesting features. Bug
reports automatically get the `bug` label, while feature requests receive the
`enhancement` label so we can triage them quickly.

## Continuous Integration

Automated tests run on GitHub Actions for each push and pull request, helping catch issues early.

## Code Coverage

The CI workflow runs tests with `pytest-cov` and uploads a coverage report as an artifact, so we can track how much of the codebase is exercised over time.

## Releases

All changes are documented in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). We publish GitHub
releases whenever a `v*.*.*` tag is pushed so you can easily reference past
versions.
