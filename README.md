# Hi, I'm Reuben (@rpbxbt) üëã

I'm building at the intersection of AI, deep tech, health, and wellness. My mission is **hw/acc** (health & wellness accelerationism) ‚Äî driving rapid progress toward human flourishing through technology.

## What I'm Building

I'm developing what I call **"Belonging as Knowledge Infrastructure"** ‚Äî systems that help communities build meaningful connections while leveraging collective intelligence for health and wellness outcomes.

Currently working with:
- Claude Code for AI-assisted development
- GitHub Copilot and OpenAI Codex for rapid prototyping
- Prompt engineering and systems architecture for health applications

## Core Principles

**MTSMU** - Maximally Truth-Seeking, Maximally Useful  
**HUMMBL** - Highly Useful Mental Model Base Language

These frameworks guide how I approach building technology that genuinely serves human wellbeing.

## Let's Collaborate

I'm looking for partners on health & wellness initiatives that create social experiences promoting healthy lifestyles for all. If you're working on:
- Community-driven wellness platforms
- AI applications for preventive health
- Tools that combine human connection with health outcomes

Let's connect.
